# BeatBox
Final Project for Computer Science 102 at The University of Tampa
This project was done in a group of 3 people of myself (Lauren Thull), Maddy Wessling, and Kaden Stone
We have created a music making system known as the “Beat Box Roulette” using GPIO, Raspberry Pi, and a breadboard.
The ”Beat Box Roulette” is just like its counterparts’ name, however, it uses code to mimic and produce sounds that you hear. By simply pressing a button, you can make various premade sounds in any combination.
